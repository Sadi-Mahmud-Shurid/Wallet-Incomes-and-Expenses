Wallet (Incomes and Expenses) is a sophisticated console application showcasing the power of advanced C programming techniques. This application seamlessly manages your financial transactions, leveraging several key features:

Structures for Enhanced Data Management: Wallet employs C structures to handle data efficiently. Two main structures are used - one to manage dates, and another to capture income and expenses. This structured approach enhances data organization and accessibility.

File Management System for Data Persistence: Wallet takes full advantage of file I/O operations to persist your financial data. It opens distinct files for income and expenses, allowing you to maintain a historical record of your financial transactions.

Dynamic Memory Allocation with calloc(): The 'showincome()' and 'showexpense()' functions utilize dynamic memory allocation to provide a dynamic and efficient memory management system. Dynamic allocation enhances memory usage and avoids memory leakage. This advanced technique ensures the application's scalability and reliability.

Data Filtering by Date: Wallet incorporates advanced date-based data filtering. The 'incomebydate()' and 'expensebydate()' functions empower users to query their financial history based on specific dates. This feature streamlines financial analysis and planning.

Wallet, designed using advanced C programming principles, offers a robust and structured approach to personal finance management. Experience efficient data management, enhanced file operations, and dynamic memory allocation in a user-friendly console application.

Explore Wallet and take control of your financial transactions with advanced C programming at your fingertips.
